# Numerical Experiments with FVK Plates and Disclinations

## Series 001 Overview

This script contains material for conducting numerical experiments on FVK (Foppl-von K치rm치n) plates subjected to disclination loading. The experiments aim to investigate the behavior of FVK plates under various loading conditions and parameter configurations.

## Model Description: monopole

The model used in these experiments is based on the Foppl-von K치rm치n plate theory, which describes the deformation of thin elastic plates. The equations governing the FVK plate model are solved numerically using finite element methods.

$$
\mathcal {E}(y) = -E_m(v) + E_b(w) + E_c(v, w) - \frac{R^4}{E h^4} p_0 \mathcal L_{\text{tr}}(w) +\frac{R^2}{h^2} \langle \delta(x-x_0), v\rangle
$$
where the state is $y=(v, w)$, $v\in H^2_0(B_R)$ is Airy stress potential, $w\in H^2_0(B_R)$ is the transverse displacement, and $p_0$ is set so that the coefficient of $\mathcal L_{\text{tr}}(w)$ is one.

## Loading Conditions

Disclinations, which are topological (so-called) defects in the crystal lattice, are used to simulate loading conditions in the FVK plates. 
<!-- The positions and strengths of the disclinations are varied to study their effects on the deformation and stress distribution in the plates. -->
Experiments of the 001 Series run parametrically with respect to the thickness of the plate to study the relative contribution of transverse pressure and disclinations in the stress distribution in the plates.

## Rationale

The numerical experiments are conducted to:

- Investigate the deformation behavior of FVK plates under different loading conditions.
- Study the influence of the thickness on the stress distribution in the plates.
- Validate the numerical results against analytical solutions where possible.
