## 1. Numerical Setup

### 1.1 Variational Problem

-   Brief description of the problem being solved.
-   Reference to the finite element discretisation and solver configuration.

### 1.2 Implementation Details

The numerical solution of the variational problem presented in Section 5 is carried out leveraging the dolfinx/FEniCSx finite element platform and relying on PETSc [~cite] for efficient linear and (parallel) data management. Our implementation, https://github.com/kumiori/disclinations implements Lagrange finite elements whose order can be changed at runtime, for flexible accuracy in the discretisation of the variational principle.
More specifically, we use SNES, the Newton nonlinear solver provided by PETSc without step adjustment ('basic lineasearch', cf. manual). The iterative subproblems are solved by a Krylov subspace method with LU factorization as preconditioner (ksp...: preonly, pc_type: lu).

The numerical tolerances for all the presented numerical simulations are
• Step tolerance: snes_stol = 1e-6
• Absolute tolerance: snes_atol = 1e-6
• Relative tolerance: snes_rtol = 1e-6
• Maximum iterations: snes_max_it = 200,
finally, the numerical penalisation parameter (cf. ...) is set to $\alpha=xxx$.

Experiments are performed on a circular domain $\Omega := B_1(0)$ centered in the origin, meshed with triangular (Delaunay) elements of typical size $\eta = 0.05$, which corresponds to 1,595 nodes and xxxx elements.
We employ third-order Lagrange elements for both the transverse displacement ($w$) and the Airy stress potential ($v$), to ensure sufficient smoothness of the unknown fields the computation of the (piecewise linear) Gaussian curvature. This choice of discretisation implies matrix sizes of approx. ...K entries.

The non-dimensional formulation involves two tunable parameters: the aspect ratio ($\beta = R/h \gg 1$) measuring the plate's slenderness, and the relative transverse pressure ($p_0/E$) with respect to the Young modulus, measuring the membrane stiffness.
Finally, the disclination strength, characterised by the Frank angle, is fixed to $\pm 1$, to qualitatively distinguish positive from negative induced membrane stresses, respectively corresponding to membrane compression and tension.

All computations are performed using the non-dimensional formulation, likewise are the plots representing the energy contributions and the mechanical fields.

## 2. Verification Tests

Validation experiments, functional in establishing the reliability of the numerical framework and its ability to capture key physical behaviors, provide substantiation that the computational implementation accurately represents the mathematical model of the mechanical system within specified accuracy, with respect to closed form solutions.

 <!-- The aim of validation is twofold:

1. Quantitative Accuracy: Demonstrating that the numerical results match known solutions within acceptable bounds.
2. Qualitative Insights: Ensuring that the model captures the essential physical mechanisms and trends inherent to the system.
 -->

We focus on two configurations: kinematically compatible loads through transverse surface pressure and kinematically incompatible loads generated by a dipole of disclinations, symmetrically distributed around the centre of the plate.

### 2.1 Plate with Kinematically Compatible Loads: transverse pressure

Rescaling nondimensionalisation, all test collapse to ...

Let $\theta = 0$ and $p(x)  = p_0\frac{40}{3} (1 - r^2(x) )^4 + \frac{16}{3} (11 + r^2(x) )$, then $w(x) $ = $w_0 (1 - r^2(x) )^2$ and $v(x) =v_0  (-\frac{1}{12} (1 - r^2(x) )^2 -\frac{1}{18} (1 - r^2(x) )^3 -\frac{1}{24} (1 - r^2(x) )^4)$ solve eq ....

Here, the non-dimensional parameters read $p_0=\sqrt{\frac{2D^3}{E h}}$, $w_0=\sqrt{\frac{2D}{E h}},$ and $ v_0 =\frac{D}{h}$, owing to which, the nondimensional formulation involving only transverse load is independent of the aspect ratio.

In Figures \ref{} we compare the profiles of the approximate solutions of the (three?) finite element formulations introduced in section \ref{} to the analytical solution above, along the segment $x_2 = 0$.

Remark that, because $v$ plays the role of the membrane stress potential (?), its sign locally informs of the positive vs. negative character of membrane strains.

Transverse pressure induces bending which in turn, induces tensile (positive) membrane strains.

Note the inversion of curvature due to the clamping boundary condition. In the image, the red locus corresponds to $x: \kappa(x)=0$

### 2.2 Plate with Kinematically Incompatible Loads, Dipole, Parametric varying aspect ratio

To verify our numerical implementation for a nontrivial incompatible loading against closed form analytic solutions,
the second setup involves a plate loaded with a dipole of disclinations symmetrically arranged around the centre of the plate.

Let $\theta(x) = \delta(x-0.2 e_1) - \delta(x+0.2 e_1), p(x)= 0$.
Then $w(x) \equiv 0$ and $v(x) = v_0( \rho^2(x) \ln(\rho^2(x)) - \rho^2(x) + 1)$ solves \eqref{2406171748}.
here $v_0=\frac{E h s}{16\pi}$
We solve [...] with $\gamma = 0$, for varying $\beta$ between $10$ and $X00$.

$w=0$ is an admissible solution for the dipole problem

Figure, ..., show energy scaling as a function of the aspect ratio, fourth power of $\beta$.
This behaviour corresponds to the expected energy scaling, by remarking that the multiplicative factor which scales the membrane equations - linear when $w=0$ - is $\beta^2$. The stress solution is hence quadratic in $\beta^2$ thus exponent of the energy.
On the other hand, the bending energy and the coupling energy are zero.

Figure ... compares the profiles of approximate finite element solutions with respect to the closed form analytic solutions.

Figure ... shows the fields $w, v$ on the two-dimensional computational domain, the dots mark the locations of the disclinations (colour coding),

Figure shows the scalar stress potential associated to the positive (colour) and negative (colour) disclination, respectively inducing a locally tensile and compressive state.

## 3. Parametric Experiments

### 3.1 Mixed Loading: Disclination monopole and surface pressure, Varying Thickness

We perform a series of parametric experiments investigating mixed-mode loading combining surface pressure and a disclination monopole, as the plate's aspect ratio is varied whilst keeping the prefactor of the transverse external load $\gamma \beta^4$ constant and equal to one. This implies that, as $\beta$ varies between $10$ and $X00$, the physical dimensional surface pressure decreases with the inverse fourth power of the dimensional thickness.

Nondimensional energy plots show the energy scaling of the different components of the energy. Similarly to the dipole setting, the membrane energy scales with the fourth power of the aspect ratio, whereas the non-dimensional bending energy decreases with a (negative) exponent smaller than $-2$ [show the bound] (more precisely, $-1.65$).

For large values of the aspect ratio, small numerical oscillations appear on the bending term, whose order of magnitude is 8 orders of magnitude smaller than the dominant membrane energy term.

In the dimensionless formulation presented [X], $\beta$ acts as a gain for the distribution of disclinations, while $\gamma$ modulates the external load.

In this section we analyse the mechanics of the system by varying first $\beta$ in some appropriate range while keeping $\gamma$ constant; and then varying $\gamma$ with constant $\beta$. In order to do this, we provide an estimate for a realistic range of values for both the dimensionless parameters.

Non-dimensional transverse displacement goes to zero.

We tune $\overline{p_0}$ to (a multiplier for) the weight of the plate, i.e. considering a density $\rho_{\text{D}} = O(10^3 kg/m^3)$ (corresponding to a reference density for steel/metal) and denoting by $g$ the gravitational acceleration we obtain

$\overline{p_0} \sim \rho_{\text{D}} g  h \sim 10^2 \text{Pa}$

-   **Results**: Parametric plots (e.g., energy terms, deformation profiles).

For large values of $a$, $h$ is small and $p_0$ growths with the fourth power of $h$. For $p_0 \equiv 0$, $w \equiv 0$ in $B_1(0)$ solves the out-of-plane equation. This is the reason why in Figure \ref{fig:24108179} the transverse displacement approaches zero as $a$ increases. As a consequence, $v$ in equation \eqref{2410161145} is only activated by $\delta(0)$ and hence asymptotically approaches $v^0(x)$, solution to the problem

$$
\left\{
    \begin{aligned}
        &\Delta^2 v^0 = XXX \delta(0) && \text{ in } B_1(0) \\
        &v^0 = \partial_n v^0 = 0 && \text{ on } \partial B_1(0)
    \end{aligned}
\right.
$$

$$
    v^0(x) = E h s \mathcal{G}_{\Omega}(x) \quad \Rightarrow |\!| v^0 |\!|_{L^2(\Omega)} = \frac{E h s}{30\pi} \approx 10^5 N/m
$$

where $\mathcal{G}_{\Omega}$ is the Green function of the biharmonic problem in $H^2_0(\Omega)$ and is equal to

$$
    \mathcal{G}_{\Omega}(x) = \frac{1}{16\pi} \Big( 1- |x|^2 + |x|^2 \ln (|x|^2) \Big), \qquad x\in \Omega
$$

### 3.2 Mixed Loading: Varying Pressure

this setup shows a relatively weak coupling
across the entire range of the loading parameter, the membrane energy is constant and matches the energy estimate provided by the closed form solution for the fundamental monopole solution. On the other hand, the bending energy is quadratic with respect to the load multiplier, as expected by inspecting the (strong form of the) bending problem whilst considering the stress potential a given.
As the value of the surface pressure varies, the stress potential shows a self-similar profile (cf images), whereas the transverse displacement progressively localises the deformation around the (clamped) boundary.
